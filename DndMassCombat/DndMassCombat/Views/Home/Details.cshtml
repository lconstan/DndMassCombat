            This page provide explanation on how the fights are handled. Please note that all units within a group must be the same.<br/>
            Each click on the <em>Attack</em> button simulates a D&D fight round. You can edit the group's <em>Hit point</em> at any time to match the events in your battle (for instance, player attack).<br/>
            <em>Unit count</em> is dynamically computed from the group <em>Hit point</em>, hence it is read only. It is computed as Floor(Army <em>Hit point</em> / Unit <em>Hit point</em>)
