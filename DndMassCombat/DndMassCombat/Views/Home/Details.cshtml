            This page provide explanations on how the fights are handled. Please note that all units within a group must be the same.<br/>
            Each click on the <em>Attack</em> button simulates a D&D fight round. You can edit the group's <em>Hit point</em> or <em>Unit count</em> at any time to match the events in your battle (for instance, player attack so decrement <em>Hit point</em>).<br/>

        <p>
            There are several steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attacking unit roll a D20 and add its <em>Hit Bonus</em>. This gives the scoring attack.</li>
            <li>If the scoring attack is strictly lower than opponent <em>Armor Class</em>, the hit is considered as missed and no damage will be done.</li>
            <li>If the scoring attack is greater or equal to the opponent <em>Armor Class</em>, <em>Damage</em> + <em>Damage bonus</em> will substracted to opponent group <em>Hit point</em>.</li>
        </ul>
